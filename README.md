## Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` folder:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

Run the backend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Server runs on `http://localhost:5000`

---

## Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Open `src/api/client.js` and update the `BASE_URL` to your machine's local IP:

```js
const BASE_URL = "http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:5000";
```

Run the frontend:

```bash
npx expo start --web
```

Opens at `http://localhost:8081`

To run on mobile, install **Expo Go** on your phone and scan the QR code.

| Method | Route                   | Description                 |
| ------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| POST   | /auth/register          | Register a new user         |

## Features Built

- User registration and login with JWT authentication
- Product listing with images, stock count, and descriptions
- Add to cart with stock validation
- Cart management — update quantity, remove items, line totals
- Empty state screens for both products and cart
- Loading and error states on every API call
- Order summary screen with Place Order button
- Cart persists across sessions using MongoDB

---

## Bonus Features

- ✅ Cart persisted in MongoDB — survives page refresh
- ✅ Loading and error states on every API call
- ✅ Order summary screen with Place Order button
- ✅ Quantity validation — + button disabled at stock limit

---

## Known Limitations

- Expo Go incompatible with SDK 56 — tested via npx expo start --web
- No real payment integration (Place Order clears cart only)
- Images are loaded from Unsplash URLs — requires internet connection
- Frontend IP address needs to be updated manually when network changes

---

## What I'd Improve With More Time

- Add search and filter functionality on the products screen
- Implement proper order history stored in the database
- Add real payment gateway integration (Razorpay or Stripe)
- Deploy backend to Railway or Render and frontend to Expo EAS
- Improve mobile responsiveness and add animations
- Add the number on cart button saying the number of items present
